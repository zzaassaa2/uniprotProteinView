# uniprotProteinView

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of uniprotProteinView is to provide a means to show a graphical representation of the UniProt data as well as allow easy cross comparison of features between different proteins for easy analysis of protein features.

# Installation

To download package:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zzaassaa2/uniprotProteinView", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("uniprotProteinView")
```

# Overview

The uniprotProteinView package provides a single function called `drawProtein`. To see further documentation, use:

```r
ls("package:uniprotProteinView")
```

To view an interactive shiny app, you can visit the webpage:

TODO

Otherwise the most simple usage of the function `drawProtein` is to supply it with a protein key_code, this can be found from the Uniprot webpage at [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/)
Once there, search for your protein and get the protein key_code

This code can then be used as shown below, for example purpose, we will use human transcription factor p65, with code Q04206.

```r
uniprotProteinView::drawProtein("Q04206")
```

Here the function will search the Uniprot database for the protein, and then draw the main chain. Further details about the structure can be added, for further information look through the vignettes:

```r
browseVignettes("uniprotProteinView")
```

An example of a more advance usage, using two proteins is such:

```r
uniprotProteinView::drawProtein(
  proteins = list(source = c("Q04206", "Q9D270"), colors = c("green", "green")),
  types = list(type = c("domain", "region of interest"), colors = c("red", "purple")),
  dess = list(type = "phos", colors = "blue"),
  structure = list(type = c("strand", "helix", "turn"), colors = c("green", "orange", "purple")),
  singleOffset = 2
)
```

# Contributions

The author of the package is George Zorn. The xml retrieval functions make use of the `XML` and `httr` R packages for xml parsing and data retrieval, respectively. The plot drawing functions make use of the `plotly` R package in order to draw and label the plot. The package also TODO-shiny
