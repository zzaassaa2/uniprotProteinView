# Overview

This package provides the user the means to plot proteins with specified features plotted out, as provided from the UniProt API. There are two functions exported from this package: `drawProtein()` and `runUniprotProteinView()`. The former is the main drawing function, while the later is used to start a shiny app. The user can also view the shiny app for this package at XXXXXXXXXXXXX TODO.

# Run Shiny App

The Shiny app provides an interactive means to use the graph, viewable by either using the website: xxxxxxxxxx todo, or running:

```{}
uniprotProteinView::runUniprotProteinView()
```

# Draw Proteins

The simplest usage of the `drawProtein()` function is to provide it a string of the UniProt protein ID, that can be found at https://www.uniprot.org/ where the user can then find their desired protein, and get the protein key_code

This code can then be used as shown below, for example purpose, we will use human transcription factor p65, with code Q04206.

```{eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
uniprotProteinView::drawProtein("Q04206")
```

Multiple proteins can be viewed at the same time using either a vector or list

```{eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#These two function will respond the same way

uniprotProteinView::drawProtein(c("Q04206", "Q9D270"))#Using a vector

uniprotProteinView::drawProtein(list("Q04206", "Q9D270"))#Using a list
```
